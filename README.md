# Mega-Schematics-Downloader
This is a simple Mega.nz downloader for my collected schematics and boarviews for laptops, gpu's, motherboards.

This app will check if i updated the mega link or not on (Migrated to github but older version will still check on my server). Feel free to check the source code.

Anyways, check out the [release](https://github.com/KiKiHUN1/Mega-Schematics-Downloader/releases) if you wan't to use it.


btw.: you can edit the mega link and use this code to download files inside folder trees.

The app window:
